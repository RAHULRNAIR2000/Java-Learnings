# Basics of Java

     1. JVM and JDK
     
     Putting it all together: Imagine you're a developer creating a Java application. 
     You use the JDK (toolbox) to write and compile your code. Once your application is 
     compiled into bytecode, it can be executed on any system with the JRE (reading lamp and chair),
     which includes the JVM (translator) to run your application smoothly across different platforms.

# Concepts of object-oriented programming in Java

     1. Class, objects
     2. Constructors
     3. Packages
     4. Acess modifiers
     5. Inheritance, Types of inheritance
     
          Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a new class is derived from
          an existing class (superclass). The derived class inherits the members (fields and methods) of the superclass. 
          In real life, think of inheritance as a parent passing on genetic traits to their child.
          The child inherits characteristics from the parent, like eye color or height.
          Use the keyword "extends" to use the methods and variables of the parent class.

          Types

          Single inheritance
          Multilevel inheritance
          Hierarchical inheritance
          Hybrid inheritance

          Multiple inheritance is not in java (for that we use interfaces)

          
          
          
     6. Polymorphism
     
     7. Abstraction/Abstract Methods
     
          Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details and
          showing only the essential features of an object. In real life, think 
          of a car dashboard. When you drive a car, you only interact with the
          dashboard (like a speedometer or fuel gauge), not the internal combustion engine
          or the complex mechanics. Similarly, in programming, abstraction allows you 
          to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it


     
     8. Interface
     
          interface is a blueprint of a class
          It cannot have fields (variables) or constructors.

     9. Enums
     10. Vector
     11. Created custom LinkedList in Java
     12. Doubly Linked List
     13. File handling in Java
     14. Stack in Java
     15. Threads in Java
     16. Essentials for react
     17. Selenium Basics
